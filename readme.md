# rOpenSci website

Welcome to the new (October 2017) website for the rOpenSci project. Our old website ([repo](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb), [site](http://legacy.ropensci.org/)) is now archived and all new content should be added to this repository. For any issues with the site including typos or rendering issues, please file an [issue](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/issues) or send a pull request. The site automatically deploys once pull requests are merged.

### Contributing a blog post

To contribute a blog post or tech note (üôè), first get the go-ahead and a tentative publication date from our community manager [Stefanie Butland](https://ropensci.org/authors/stefanie-butland/).

Please refer to [our in-progress gitbook "rOpenSci Blog Guidelines for Authors and Editors"](https://blogguide.ropensci.org/). There we coach you in thinking through what you might say in your post ([Content Guidelines](https://blogguide.ropensci.org/content.html)) and suggest a workflow with templates, a checklist, and advice on incorporating commonly used elements ([Technical Guidelines](https://blogguide.ropensci.org/technical.html)).

Briefly, the process is:
1. Fork the repository (repo) of the rOpenSci website.
1. Draft your post in R Markdown or Markdown and create or update your author metadata.
1. Preview and refine your post locally.
1. Submit via pull request and preview your post.
1. A blog editor reviews your post.
1. Revise your post in response to review.
1. Enjoy having your work promoted.

### Updating page templates
