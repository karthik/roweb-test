`fulltext` is a package to facilitate text mining. It focuses on open access journals. This package makes it easier to search for articles, download those articles in full text if available, convert pdf format to plain text, and extract text chunks for vizualization/analysis. We are planning to add bits for analysis in future versions. The steps in bullet form:

* Search - search for articles
* Retrieve - get full text
* Convert - convert from format X to Y
* Text - if needed, get text from pdfs/etc.
* Extract - pull out the bits of articles that you want

### Installation

You can install from CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("fulltext")
```

Or the development version from GitHub

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/fulltext")
```

Load the package

```{r}
library("fulltext")
```



### Usage

#### Search for articles

Search for the term _ecology_ in PLOS journals.

```{r}
(res1 <- ft_search(query = 'ecology', from = 'plos'))
```

Each publisher/search-engine has a slot with metadata and data

```{r}
res1$plos
```

#### Get full text

Using the results from `ft_search()` we can grab full text of some articles

```{r}
(out <- ft_get(res1))
```

Dig in to the PLOS data

```{r}
out$plos
```

Dig in further to get to one of the articles in XML format

```{r}
library("xml2")
xml2::read_xml(out$plos$data$data$`10.1371/journal.pone.0059813`)
```

#### Extract text from pdfs

Ideally for text mining you have access to XML or other text based formats. However, sometimes you only have access to PDFs. In this case you want to extract text from PDFs. `fulltext` can help with that.

You can extract from any pdf from a file path, like:

```{r}
path <- system.file("examples", "example1.pdf", package = "fulltext")
ft_extract(path)
```

Let's search for articles from arXiv, a preprint service. Here, get pdf from an article with ID `cond-mat/9309029`:

```{r}
res <- ft_get('cond-mat/9309029', from = "arxiv")
res2 <- ft_extract(res)
res2$arxiv$data
```

And a short snippet of the full text

```{r eval=FALSE}
res2$arxiv$data$data[[1]]$data
#> "arXiv:cond-mat/9309029v8 26 Jan 1994, , FERMILAB-PUB-93/15-T March 1993, Revised:
#> January 1994, The Thermodynamics and Economics of Waste, Dallas C. Kennedy, Research
#> Associate, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, P.O. Box 500 MS106, Batavia, Illinois
#> 60510 USA, Abstract, The increasingly relevant problem of natural resource use and
#> waste production, disposal, and reuse is examined from several viewpoints: economic,
#> technical, and thermodynamic. Alternative economies are studied, with emphasis on
#> recycling of waste to close the natural resource cycle. The physical nature of human
#> economies and constraints on recycling and energy efficiency are stated in terms
#> ..."
```

#### Extract text chunks

We have a few functions to help you pull out certain parts of an article. For example, perhaps you want to get just the authors from your articles, or just the abstracts.

Here, we'll search for some PLOS articles, then get their full text, then extract various parts of each article with `chunks()`.

```{r}
res <- ft_search(query = "ecology", from = "plos")
(x <- ft_get(res))
```

Extract DOIs

```{r}
x %>% chunks("doi")
```

Extract DOIs and categories

```{r}
x %>% chunks(c("doi","categories"))
```

`tabularize` attempts to help you put the data that comes out of `chunks()` in to a `data.frame`, that we all know and love.

```{r}
x %>% chunks(c("doi", "history")) %>% tabularize()
```
