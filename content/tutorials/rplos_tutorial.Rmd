The `rplos` package interacts with the API services of [PLoS](http://www.plos.org/) (Public Library of Science) Journals. You used to need an API key to work with this package - that is no longer needed!

This tutorial will go through three use cases to demonstrate the kinds
of things possible in `rplos`.

* Search across PLoS papers in various sections of papers
* Search for terms and visualize results as a histogram OR as a plot through time
* Text mining of scientific literature

## Installation


```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rplos")
```

Or development version

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rplos")
```

```{r}
library("rplos")
```

## Usage

### Search across PLoS papers in various sections of papers

`searchplos` is a general search, and in this case searches for the term
**Helianthus** and returns the DOI's of matching papers

```{r searchplos1}
searchplos(q= "Helianthus", fl= "id", limit = 5)
```

Get only full article DOIs

```{r searchplos2}
searchplos(q="*:*", fl='id', fq='doc_type:full', start=0, limit=5)
```

Get DOIs for only PLoS One articles

```{r searchplos3}
searchplos(q="*:*", fl='id', fq='cross_published_journal_key:PLoSONE', start=0, limit=5)
```

Get DOIs for full article in PLoS One

```{r searchplos4}
searchplos(q="*:*", fl='id',
   fq=list('cross_published_journal_key:PLoSONE', 'doc_type:full'),
   start=0, limit=5)
```

Search for many terms

```{r searchplos5}
q <- c('ecology','evolution','science')
lapply(q, function(x) searchplos(x, limit=2))
```

### Search on specific sections

A suite of functions were created as light wrappers around `searchplos` as a shorthand to search specific sections of a paper.

* `plosauthor` searchers in authors
* `plosabstract` searches in abstracts
* `plostitle` searches in titles
* `plosfigtabcaps` searches in figure and table captions
* `plossubject` searches in subject areas

`plosauthor` searches across authors, and in this case returns the authors of the matching papers. the fl parameter determines what is returned

```{r plosauthor}
plosauthor(q = "Eisen", fl = "author", limit = 5)
```

`plosabstract` searches across abstracts, and in this case returns the id and title of the matching papers

```{r plosabstract}
plosabstract(q = 'drosophila', fl='id,title', limit = 5)
```

`plostitle` searches across titles, and in this case returns the title and journal of the matching papers

```{r plostitle}
plostitle(q='drosophila', fl='title,journal', limit=5)
```

### Search for terms and visualize results as a histogram OR as a plot through time

`plosword` allows you to search for 1 to K words and visualize the results
as a histogram, comparing number of matching papers for each word

```{r plosword1}
out <- plosword(list("monkey", "Helianthus", "sunflower", "protein", "whale"),
    vis = "TRUE")
out$table
```

```{r plosword1plot, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
out$plot
```

You can also pass in curl options, in this case get verbose information on the curl call.

```{r plosword2}
plosword('Helianthus', callopts=list(verbose=TRUE))
```

### Visualize terms

`plot_throughtime` allows you to search for up to 2 words and visualize the results as a line plot through time, comparing number of articles matching through time. Visualize with the ggplot2 package, only up to two terms for now.

```{r throughtime1, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
library("ggplot2")
plot_throughtime(terms = "phylogeny", limit = 200) + geom_line(size=2, color='black')
```

### Faceted search

In addition to `searchplos()` and related searching functions, there are a few slightly different ways to search: faceting and highlighted searches. Faceting allows you to ask, e.g., how many articles are published in each of the PLOS journals. Highlighting allows you to ask, e.g., highlight terms that I search for in the text results given back, which can make downstream processing easier, and help visualize search results (see `highbrow()` below).

Facet by journal

```{r facet1}
facetplos(q='*:*', facet.field='journal')
```

Using `facet.query` to get counts

```{r facet2}
facetplos(q='*:*', facet.field='journal', facet.query='cell,bird')
```

Date faceting

```{r facet3}
facetplos(q='*:*', url=url, facet.date='publication_date',
  facet.date.start='NOW/DAY-5DAYS', facet.date.end='NOW', facet.date.gap='+1DAY')
```

### Highlighted search

Search for the term _alcohol_ in the abstracts of articles, return only 10 results

```{r high1}
highplos(q='alcohol', hl.fl = 'abstract', rows=2)
```

Search for the term _alcohol_ in the abstracts of articles, and return fragment size of 20 characters, return only 5 results

```{r high2}
highplos(q='alcohol', hl.fl='abstract', hl.fragsize=20, rows=2)
```

Search for the term _experiment_ across all sections of an article, return id (DOI) and title fl only, search in full articles only (via `fq='doc_type:full'`), and return only 10 results

```{r high3}
highplos(q='everything:"experiment"', fl='id,title', fq='doc_type:full',
   rows=2)
```

### Visualize highligted searches

Browse highlighted fragments in your default browser

This first examle, we only looko at 10 results

```{r eval=FALSE}
out <- highplos(q='alcohol', hl.fl = 'abstract', rows=10)
highbrow(out)
```

![highbrow1](../assets/tutorial-images/rplos/highbrow.png)

But it works quickly with lots of results too

```{r eval=FALSE}
out <- highplos(q='alcohol', hl.fl = 'abstract', rows=1200)
highbrow(out)
```

![highbrow2](../assets/tutorial-images/rplos/highbrow_big.png)
