`taxize` is a taxonomic toolbelt for R. `taxize` wraps APIs for a large suite of taxonomic databases availab on the web.


### Installation

First, install and load `taxize` into the R session.

```{r installtaxizecran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("taxize")
```

Or, install development version from GitHub

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/taxize")
```

```{r loadtaxize}
library("taxize")
```


## Usage

### Resolve taxonomic name

This is a common task in biology. We often have a list of species names and we want to know a) if we have the most up to date names, b) if our names are spelled correctly, and c) the scientific name for a common name. One way to resolve names is via the Global Names Resolver (GNR) service provided by the [Encyclopedia of Life][eol]. Here, we are searching for two misspelled names:

```{r resolvenames}
temp <- gnr_resolve(names = c("Helianthos annus", "Homo saapiens"))
head(temp)
```

The correct spellings are *Helianthus annuus* and *Homo sapiens*.

Another common use case is when there are many synonyms for a species. In this example, we have three synonyms of the currently accepted name for a species.

```{r synonyms, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA}
mynames <- c("Helianthus annuus ssp. jaegeri", "Helianthus annuus ssp. lenticularis", "Helianthus annuus ssp. texanus")
(tsn <- get_tsn(mynames, accepted = FALSE))
lapply(tsn, itis_acceptname)
```

### Retrieve higher taxonomic names

Another task biologists often face is getting higher taxonomic names for a taxa list. Having the higher taxonomy allows you to put into context the relationships of your species list. For example, you may find out that species A and species B are in Family C, which may lead to some interesting insight, as opposed to not knowing that Species A and B are closely related. This also makes it easy to aggregate/standardize data to a specific taxonomic level (e.g., family level) or to match data to other databases with different taxonomic resolution (e.g., trait databases).

A number of data sources in taxize provide the capability to retrieve higher taxonomic names, but we will highlight two of the more useful ones: [Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS)][itis] and [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)][ncbi]. First, we'll search for two species, *Abies procera} and *Pinus contorta* within ITIS.

```{r classification}
specieslist <- c("Abies procera","Pinus contorta")
classification(specieslist, db = 'itis')
```

It turns out both species are in the family Pinaceae. You can also get this type of information from the NCBI by doing `classification(specieslist, db = 'ncbi')`.

Instead of a full classification, you may only want a single name, say a family name for your species of interest. The function *tax_name} is built just for this purpose. As with the `classification` function you can specify the data source with the `db` argument, either ITIS or NCBI.

```{r taxname, eval=TRUE,cache=TRUE}
tax_name(query = "Helianthus annuus", get = "family", db = "ncbi")
```

I may happen that a data source does not provide information on the queried species, than one could take the result from another source and union the results from the different sources.

### Interactive name selection

As mentioned most databases use a numeric code to reference a species. A general workflow in taxize is: Retrieve Code for the queried species and then use this code to query more data/information.

Below are a few examples. When you run these examples in R, you are presented with a command prompt asking for the row that contains the name you would like back; that output is not printed below for brevity. In this example, the search term has many matches. The function returns a data frame of the matches, and asks for the user to input what row number to accept.

```{r interactive, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
get_uid(sciname = "Pinus")
```

In another example, you can pass in a long character vector of taxonomic names (although this one is rather short for demo purposes):

```{r interactive_many, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
splist <- c("annona cherimola", 'annona muricata', "quercus robur")
get_tsn(searchterm = splist, searchtype = "scientific")
```

There are functions for many other sources

* `get_boldid()`
* `get_colid()`
* `get_eolid()`
* `get_gbifid()`
* `get_nbnid()`
* `get_tpsid()`

Sometimes with these functions you get a lot of data back. In these cases you may want to limit your choices. Soon we will incorporate the ability to filter using `regex` to limit matches, but for now, we have a new parameter, `rows`, which lets you select certain rows. For example, you can select the first row of each given name, which means there is no interactive component:

```{r}
get_nbnid(c("Zootoca vivipara","Pinus contorta"), rows = 1)
```

Or you can select a range of rows

```{r}
get_nbnid(c("Zootoca vivipara","Pinus contorta"), rows = 1:3)
```

In addition, in case you don't want to do interactive name selection in the case where there are a lot of names, you can get all data back with functions of the form, e.g., `get_tsn_()`, and likewise for other data sources. For example:

```{r}
out <- get_nbnid_("Poa annua")
NROW(out$`Poa annua`)
```

That's a lot of data, so we can get only certain rows back

```{r}
get_nbnid_("Poa annua", rows = 1:10)
```

### Coerce numerics/alphanumerics to taxon IDs

We've also introduced in `v0.5` the ability to coerce numerics and alphanumerics to taxonomic ID classes that are usually only retrieved via `get_*()` functions.

For example, adfafd

```{r}
as.gbifid(get_gbifid("Poa annua")) # already a uid, returns the same
as.gbifid(2704179) # numeric
as.gbifid("2704179") # character
as.gbifid(list("2704179","2435099","3171445")) # list, either numeric or character
```

These `as.*()` functions do a quick check of the web resource to make sure it's a real ID. However, you can turn this check off, making this coercion much faster:

```{r}
system.time( replicate(3, as.gbifid(c("2704179","2435099","3171445"), check=TRUE)) )
system.time( replicate(3, as.gbifid(c("2704179","2435099","3171445"), check=FALSE)) )
```

### What taxa are downstream of my taxon of interest?

If someone is not a taxonomic specialist on a particular taxon he likely does not know what children taxa are within a family, or within a genus. This task becomes especially unwieldy when there are a large number of taxa downstream. You can of course go to a website like [Wikispecies][wikispecies] or [Encyclopedia of Life][eol] to get downstream names. However, taxize provides an easy way to programatically search for downstream taxa, both for the [Catalogue of Life (CoL)][col] and the [Integrated Taxonomic Information System][itis]. Here is a short example using the CoL in which we want to find all the species within the genus *Apis* (honey bees).

```{r downstream1, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
downstream("Apis", downto = "Species", db = "col")
```

We can also request data from ITIS

```{r downstream2, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
downstream("Apis", downto = "Species", db = "itis")
```

### Direct children

You may sometimes only want the direct children. We got you covered on that front, with methods for ITIS, NCBI, and Catalogue of Life. For example, let's get direct children (species in this case) of the bee genus _Apis_ using COL data:

```{r}
children(get_colid("Apis"))
```

The direct children (genera in this case) of _Pinaceae_ using NCBI data:

```{r}
children("Pinaceae", db = "ncbi")
```

### Get NCBI ID from GenBank Ids

With accession numbers

```{r}
genbank2uid(id = 'AJ748748')
```

With gi numbers

```{r}
genbank2uid(id = 62689767)
```
